The intended boundaries of Palestine were not specified. The Jewish national home was not intended to cover all of Palestine.\n\nThe second half of the declaration was added to satisfy opponents of the policy, who said that it would otherwise prejudice the position of the local population of Palestine and encourage [antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism \"Antisemitism\") worldwide by (according to the presidents of the Conjoint Committee, [David L. Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lindo_Alexander \"David Lindo Alexander\") and [Claude Montefiore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Montefiore \"Claude Montefiore\") in a letter to the _Times_) \"stamping the Jews as strangers in their native lands\". The declaration called for safeguarding the civil and religious rights for the [Palestinian Arabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Arabs \"Palestinian Arabs\"), who composed the vast majority of the local population, and the rights of Jewish communities in any other country.\n\nAllied Supreme Council assigned mandates for Palestine and Mesopotamia to Britain. Majority of the Palestinian population were not in favor of Zionism and a Zionist state establishment.\n\nThe Palestine mandate was approved on 22 July 1922. British formal international recognition of the position they had held _de facto_ in the region since the end of 1917 in Palestine and since 1920–21 in Transjordan.\n\nCurzon and the Italian and French governments rejected early drafts of the mandate because the preamble had contained a passage which read, \"Recognizing, moreover, the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine and _the claim which this gives them to reconstitute it their national home_...\"\n\nTreaty of Sevres outlines in article 4 - \"the recognition of an appropriate Jewish agency as a public body for the purpose of advising and co-operating with the Administration of Palestine in such economic, social and other matters as may affect the establishment of the Jewish National Home and the interests of the Jewish population of Palestine,\" establishes the [Jewish Agency for Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Agency_for_Israel)\n\n The proviso to this objective of the mandate was that \"nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine\"","x":-1690,"y":-210,"width":950,"height":860},
