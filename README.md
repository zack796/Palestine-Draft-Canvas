## TODO List
### This is a list of things I would like added to the canvas. If you have suggestions on what to add to the canvas, [Create and issue](https://github.com/zack796/Palestine-Draft-Canvas/issues)

- Rafah Crossing
- 2000 - Today
- Create a section of all the factions involved with simple explanations
- (maybe) re-structure to provide more separatism between the various conflicts. eg. Israel-Palestine section, Israel-Lebanon section, Israel-Jordan section, etc.
